# Titanic Survivor Prediction

This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on several features such as age, gender, class, etc. It uses Logistic Regression for classification.

The dataset is based on real Titanic data from the Kaggle Titanic competition, including information like age, passenger class, and survival status.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-The-Developer2320/titanic_survivor_prediction.git

 Install the dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open Titanic_Survivor_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter to run the notebook, preprocess the data, and train the model

## Model Explanation
 We use **Logistic Regression** to predict survival based on features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, and `Fare`. Features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
